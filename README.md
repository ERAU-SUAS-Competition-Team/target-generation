# target-generation
__Generates fake target images for testing our computer vision.__

CAN ONLY RUN ON UNIX SYSTEMS (Unless you can magically get Cairo to work on Windows)

Generates randomized png images for use in testing and developing our first competition vision system. Can be operated through basic runs, or can be used in a command line interface. (Plans)

__TODO:__
- Randomize SVG Data
- Output to png, output randomization data to json
- Create CLI
- Determine if this repo should also overlay on satellite data or not
