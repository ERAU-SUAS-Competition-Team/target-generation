# target-generation
__Generates fake target images for testing our computer vision.__

Requires Inkscape to be installed on the host system. This code is made for Inkscape 1.1.2. As they have ripped out large features before, there is no guarantee that this code will work on future versions, and it definitely won't work on version that come before 1.1 as a whole. Make sure that Inkscape is installed in a way that allows for use of its CLI functionality.

Generates randomized png images for use in testing and developing our first competition vision system. Can be operated through basic runs, or can be used in a command line interface. (Plans)

__TODO:__
- Randomize SVG Data
- Output to png, output randomization data to json
- Create CLI
- Determine if this repo should also overlay on satellite data or not
